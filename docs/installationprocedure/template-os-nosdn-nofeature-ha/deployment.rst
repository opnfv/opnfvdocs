It is important that the Verify Networks action is performed as it will verify
that communicate works for the networks you have setup, as well as check that
packages needed for a successful deployment can be fetched.

From the FUEL UI in your Environment, Select the Networks Tab and select "Connectivity check" on the left pane

   - Select <Verify Networks>

   - Continue to fix your topology (physical switch, etc) until the "Verification Succeeded" and "Your network is configured correctly" message is shown

Deploy the environment.

    - In the Fuel GUI, click on the "Dashboard" Tab.

    - Click on <Deploy Changes> in the "Ready to Deploy?" section

    - Examine any information notice that pops up and click <Deploy>

    Wait for your deployment to complete, you can view the "Dashboard"
    Tab to see the progress and status of your deployment.
