Help with Hardware Requirements
===============================

Calculate hardware requirements:

For information on compatible hardware types available for use, please see *Reference: 11*.

When choosing the hardware on which you will deploy your OpenStack
environment, you should think about:

- CPU -- Consider the number of virtual machines that you plan to deploy in your cloud environment and the CPU per virtual machine.

- Memory -- Depends on the amount of RAM assigned per virtual machine and the controller node.

- Storage -- Depends on the local drive space per virtual machine, remote volumes that can be attached to a virtual machine, and object storage.

- Networking -- Depends on the Choose Network Topology, the network bandwidth per virtual machine, and network storage.


Top of the rack (TOR) Configuration requirements
================================================

The switching infrastructure provides connectivity for the OPNFV
infrastructure operations, tenant networks (East/West) and provider
connectivity (North/South); it also provides needed connectivity for
the Storage Area Network (SAN).
To avoid traffic congestion, it is strongly suggested that three
physically separated networks are used, that is: 1 physical network
for administration and control, one physical network for tenant private
and public networks, and one physical network for SAN.
The switching connectivity can (but does not need to) be fully redundant,
in such case it comprises a redundant 10GE switch pair for each of the
three physically separated networks.

The physical TOR switches are **not** automatically configured from
the Fuel OPNFV reference platform. All the networks involved in the OPNFV
infrastructure as well as the provider networks and the private tenant
VLANs needs to be manually configured.

Manual configuration of the Brahmaputra hardware platform should
be carried out according to the OPNFV Pharos specification:
