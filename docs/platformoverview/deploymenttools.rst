Brahmaputra provides 4 different installers.

The installers will deploy the target platform onto a set of virtual or bare metal servers according
to the configuration files. After the deployment, it doesn't matter which of the installers had been used
to deploy the target scenario.

**Apex** is an OPNFV Installation tool based on RDO Manager that deploys OPNFV using the RDO Project
OpenStack Distribution.
RDO manager is a Triple-O based installation tool.
Triple-O is an image based life cycle deployment tool that is a member of the OpenStack Big Tent Governance.
Apex uses Centos on all target platforms and can deploy all SDN controllers.
