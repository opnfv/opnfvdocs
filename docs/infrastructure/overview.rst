Infrastructure Overview
=======================

OPNFV develops, operates, and maintains infrastructure which is used by the OPNFV
Community for development, integration, and testing purposes. `OPNFV
Infrastructure Working Group (Infra WG) <https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/INF>`_
oversees the OPNFV Infrastructure, ensures it is kept in a state which serves
the community in best possible way and always up to date.

Infra WG is working towards a model whereby we have a seamless pipeline
for handing resource requests from the OPNFV community for both development and
Continuous Integration perspectives. Automation of requests and integration to
existing automation tools is a primary driver in reaching this model. In the
Infra WG, we imagine a model where the Infrastructure Requirements that are
specified by a Feature, Installer or otherrelevant projects within OPNFV are
requested, provisioned, used, reported on and subsequently torn down with no (or
minimal) user intervention at the physical/infrastructure level.

Objectives of the Infra WG are

* Deliver efficiently dimensions resources to OPNFV community needs on request in a timely manner that ensure maximum usage (capacity) and maximum density (distribution of workloads)
* Satisfy the needs of the twice-yearly release projects, this includes being able to handle load (amount of projects and requests) as well as need (topology and different layouts)
* Support OPNFV community users.  As the INFRA group, we are integral to all aspects of the OPNFV Community (since it starts with the Hardware) - this can mean troubleshooting any element within the stack
* Provide a method to expand and adapt as OPNFV community needs grow and provide this to Hosting Providers (lab providers) for input in growth forecast so they can better judge how best to contribute with their resources.
* Work with reporting and other groups to ensure we have adequate feedback to the end-users of the labs on how their systems, code, feature performs.

The details of what is provided as part of the infrastructure can be seen in following chapters.
