Introduction
============

OPNFV is a carrier-grade, integrated, open source platform to accelerate the introduction
of new NFV products and services. As an open source project, OPNFV strives
to bring together the work of standards bodies, open source communities and commercial
suppliers to deliver a de facto standard open source NFV platform for the industry.

By integrating components from upstream projects, the community is able to perform performance
and use case-based testing on a variety of solutions to ensure the platformâ€™s suitability for
NFV use cases. OPNFV also works upstream with other open source communities to bring both contributions
and learnings from its work directly to those communities in the form of blueprints, patches,
and new code.

OPNFV initially focused on building NFV Infrastructure (NFVI) and Virtualized Infrastructure
Management (VIM) by integrating components from upstream projects such as OpenDaylight,
OpenStack, Ceph Storage, KVM, Open vSwitch, and Linux.
More recetly OPNFV has extended it's portfolio of forwarding soluitons to include fd.io and ODP,
is able to run on both Intel and ARM commercial & white-box hardwares, and includes
MANO components primarily for application composition and management in the Colorado release.

These capabilities, along with application programmable interfaces (APIs) to other NFV
elements, form the basic infrastructure required for Virtualized Network Functions (VNF)
and Management and Network Orchestration (MANO) components.

Concentrating on these components while also considering proposed projects on additional
topics (such as the MANO components and applciations themselves), OPNFV aims to enhance
NFV services by increasing performance and power efficiency, improving reliability,
availability and serviceability, and delivering comprehensive platform instrumentation.
