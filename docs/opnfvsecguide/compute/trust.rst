Trusted Compute
---------------

Compute security relates to the compute nodes in an OPNFV deployment. Compute nodes host various componants such as the hypervisor itself KVM-QEMU, and its serving eco-system, such as Nova (which interacts with the hypervisor using libvirt driver).

We also cover other aspects of what is considered compute security, such as trusted boot / pools, although of course, these can be extended to other actors such as neutron etworking nodes.
