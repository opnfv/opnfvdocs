Trusted Compute
===============

Compute security relates to the compute nodes in an OPNFV deployment.
Compute nodes host various componants such as the hypervisor itself KVM-QEMU,
and its serving eco-system, such as Nova (which interacts with the hypervisor
using libvirt driver).

We also cover other aspects of what is considered compute security, such as
trusted boot / pools, although of course, these can be extended to other actors
such as neutron networking nodes.
