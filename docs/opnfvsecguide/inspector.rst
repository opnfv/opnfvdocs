Inspector
=========

Inspector is an OPNFV project, to ensure the existing Audit framework for the critical components in OPNFV is extensive enough and compliant to industry standards and foreseeable business use cases.

The benefit is that:

Any NFV deployment will be easily checked for compliance towards relevant audit frameworks and that any necessary extensions to CADF are identified
It will be possible to assess the integrity of audit logs
For any NFV provider, it is necessary to provide audit data relevant to the specific industry requirements in a standard format
