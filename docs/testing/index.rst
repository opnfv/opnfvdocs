**********************************
OPNFV Testing projects placeholder
**********************************

This will be extended to include all the sub projects.  The testing WG should use this as a
staging page for all projects under it including common architecture and vision etc.

Under this section we will link to each test project.  They will need to be restructured
to best take advantage of the new format.  Requires presentation at the testing WG so they can
make plans for Danube...
