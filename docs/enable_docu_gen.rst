How to setup the workflow of automatic documentation build for your project
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Setup you repository and then clone locally**::

 ssh-add your-ssh.key

 git clone ssh://<username>@gerrit.opnfv.org:29418/<project>

 cd <project>


**Inside the repository create the following structure:**::

   gerrit.opnfv.org/<project> - docs/
                                    /main.rst
                                    /other-docus.rst
                                    /images/*.png|*.jpg


**In order to obtain a nice .html & .pdf at then end you must write you documentation using reSt markup**

quick guide: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html


**Clone the releng repository so you can created jobs for JJB**::

 git clone ssh://<username>@gerrit.opnfv.org:29418/releng


Enter the project settings::

 cd releng/jjb/<project>/


**Create build-docu.sh**

The script is the same for most of the projects and you can just copy it under your project in releng/jjb/<project>/

example: cp releng/jjb/opnfvdocs/build-docu.sh releng/jjb/<your-project>/::

 #!/bin/bash
 set -xv
 for file in $(find . -type f -iname '*.rst'); do
        file_cut="${{file%.*}}"
        html_file=$file_cut".html"
        pdf_file=$file_cut".pdf"
        rst2html $file > $html_file
        rst2pdf $file -o $pdf_file
 done



**Edit <your-project>.yml**::

 vi releng/jjb/<your-project>/<your-project>.yml


Make sure you have the job-templates set right

example: less releng/jjb/opnfvdocs/opnfvdocs.yml (pay extra attention at the "builder" sections)::

 - job-template:
        name: 'opnfvdocs-daily-{stream}'
        ...
        builders:
                - shell:
                        !include-raw build-docu.sh
                - shell: |
                        echo $PATH
                        /usr/local/bin/gsutil cp docs/*.pdf gs://artifacts.opnfv.org/opnfvdocs/docs/
                        /usr/local/bin/gsutil cp docs/*.html gs://artifacts.opnfv.org/opnfvdocs/docs/


 - job-template:
        name: 'opnfvdocs-verify'
        ...
        builders:
                - shell:
                        !include-raw build-docu.sh


 - job-template:
        name: 'opnfvdocs-merge'
        ...
        builders:
                - shell:
                        !include-raw build-docu.sh
                - shell: |
                        /usr/local/bin/gsutil cp docs/*.pdf gs://artifacts.opnfv.org/opnfvdocs/docs/
                /usr/local/bin/gsutil cp docs/*.html gs://artifacts.opnfv.org/opnfvdocs/docs/



Stage files::

 git add  build-docu.sh <project>.yml

Commit change with --signoff::

 git commit --signoff


Send code for review in Gerrit::

 git review -v




**Create the documentation using the recommended structure in your repository and submit to gerrit for review**


**Jenkins will take over and produce artifacts in the form of .html & .pdf**

Jenkins has the proper packages installed in order to produce the artifacts.


**Artifacts are stored on Google Storage (still to decide where, structure and how to present them)**

http://artifacts.opnfv.org/

example: http://artifacts.opnfv.org/opnfvdocs/docs/enable_docu_gen.pdf


**Scrape content from html artifacts on wiki**

example of what you sould write on wiki, below::

 {{scrape>http://artifacts.opnfv.org/opnfvdocs/docs/enable_docu_gen.html}}


NOTE:
------

In order to generate html & pdf documentation the needed packages are rst2pdf & python-docutils if the Jenkins is CentOS/RHEL; many variants have been tested but this is the cleanest as a solution.




**Other options to generate documentation that we tested:**


**Doxygen plugin -> HTML published plugin (html)/ LaTeX (pdf)**


Description: This was the first discovered method

- html: using Doxygen plugin + HTML publisher
  It involves some customization at doxygen level + custom html header/footer

- pdf: it generates a .pdf using latex

- Input files: .md , .rst

- Output: .html & .pdf

- Pros:

      - standard tools: doxygen, html publisher, LaTeX suite
      - doxygen plugin available in Jenkins, you just need to install it; html publisher plugin available in Jenkins, you just need to install it
      - destination files are generated fast
      - standard reStructuredText or Markdown

- Cons:

      - takes some time to customize the output in matters of template, requires custom html header/footer
      - latex suite is quite substantial in amount of packages and consumed space (around 1.2 GB)

- Tested: roughly, functional tests only



**Maven & clouddocs-maven-plugin (actually used to generate openstack-manuals)**


Description: It represents the standard tool to generate Openstack documentation manuals, uses maven, maven plugins, clouddocs-maven-plugins; location of finally generated files is the object of a small Bash script that will reside as Post-actions

- Input files: .xml

- Output: .html & .pdf

- Pros:

      - quite easy for initial setup
      - uses openstack documentation generation flows as for openstack-manuals (clouddocs-maven-plugin), maven installs all you need generate the documentation

- Cons:

      - could be tricky to generate a custom layout, knowledge about Maven plugins required, .pom editing
      - dependent of multiple maven plugins
      - input files are .xml and xml editing knowledge is required

- Tested: roughly, functional tests only



**Sphinx & LaTeX suite**


Description: The easiest to install, the cleanest in matter of folder & files structure, uses standard tools available in repositories; location of finally generated files is the object of a small Bash script that will reside as Post-actions

- Input files: .rst as default

- Output: .html & .pdf

- Pros:

      - standard tools: Python Sphinx, LaTeX suite
      - destination files are generated fast
      - standard reStructuredText as default; other inputs can be configured
      - Sphinx's installation is very clean in matters of folder structure; the cleanest from all tested variants
      - latex suite is also easy to install via yum/apt and available in general repos
      - everyone is migration from other tools to Spinx lately; it provides more control and better looking documentation
      - can be used also for source-code documentation, specially if you use Python

- Cons:

      - takes some time to customize the output in matters of template, requires custom html header/footer
      - latex suite is quite substantial in amount of packages and consumed space (around 1.2 GB)

- Tested: roughly, functional tests only
