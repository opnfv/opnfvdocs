Using common platform components
================================

This section outlines basic usage principals and methods for some of the commonly deployed
components of supported OPNFV scenario's in Brahmaputra.
The subsections provide an outline of how these components are commonly used and how to address them

this guide will provide direction to the relevant documentation made available by those communities
to better help you navigate the OPNFV deployment.
