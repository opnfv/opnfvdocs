Abstract
--------
OPNFV is a collaborative project aimed at providing a variety of virtualisation
deployments intended to host applications serving the networking and carrier
industry. This document provides guidance and instructions for using platform
features designed to support these applications, made available in the OPNFV
Colorado release.

This document is not intended to replace or replicate documentation from other
open source projects such as OpenStack or OpenDaylight, rather highlight the
features and capabilities delivered through the OPNFV project.

============
Introduction
============
OPNFV provides a variety of virtual infrastructure deployments designed to host
virtualised network functions (VNFs). This guide intends to help users of the
platform leverage the features and capabilities delivered by the OPNFV project.

OPNFV Continuous Integration builds, deploys and tests combinations of virtual
infrastructure components in what are defined as scenarios. A scenario may
include components such as OpenStack, OpenDaylight, OVS, KVM etc. where each
scenario will include different source components or configurations. Scenarios
are designed to enable specific features and capabilities in the platform that
can be leveraged by the OPNFV user community.

================
Feature overview
================

The following links outline the feature deliveries from the participant OPNFV
projects in the Colorado release. Each of the participating projects provides
detailed descriptions about the delivered features. Including use cases,
implementation and configuration specifics on a per OPNFV project basis.

The following are User Guides and assume that the reader has already some
information about a given projects specifics and deliverables. These guides
are intended to be used following the installation of a given OPNFV installer
to allow a user to deploy and implement feature delivered by OPNFV.

If you are unsure about the specifics of a given project, please refer to the
OPNFV projects <Home page> and subsequent projects pages for specifics.
