Abstract
--------
OPNFV is a collaborative project aimed at providing a variety of virtualisation deployments intended to host applications serving the networking and carrier industry. This document provides guidance and instructions for using platform features designed to support these applications, made available in the OPNFV Coloradorelease.

This document is not intended to replace or replicate documentation from other open source projects such as OpenStack or OpenDaylight, rather highlight the features and capabilities delivered through the OPNFV project.

Introduction
============
OPNFV provides a variety of virtual infrastructure deployments designed to host virtualised network functions (VNFs). This guide intends to help users of the platform leverage the features and capabilities delivered by the OPNFV project.

OPNFV Continuous Integration builds, deploys and tests combinations of virtual infrastructure components in what are defined as scenarios. A scenario may include components such as OpenStack, OpenDaylight, OVS, KVM etc. where each scenario will include different source components or configurations. Scenarios are designed to enable specific features and capabilities in the platform that can be leveraged by the OPNFV user community.
