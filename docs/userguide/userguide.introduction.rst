Introduction
============
OPNFV provides a variety of virtual infrastructure deployments designed to host virtualised network functions (VNFs). This guide intends to help users of the platform leverage the features and capabilities delivered by the OPNFV project.

OPNFV Continuous Integration builds, deploys and tests combinations of virtual infrastructure components in what are defined as scenarios. A scenario may include components such as OpenStack, OpenDaylight, OVS, KVM etc. where each scenario will include different source components or configurations. Scenarios are designed to enable specific features and capabilities in the platform that can be leveraged by the OPNFV user community.
