Abstract
========

One of Anuket's project goals is to reduce time to integrate and deploy cloud infrastructures and onboard VNF/CNFs for
those who supply components and those who operationalize these platforms. The Anuket community does this by
implementing, testing and deploying tools for conformance and performance of cloud infrastructures, aligned with
industry reference architectures. This document provides guidance and instructions for using platform features designed
to support the tools that are made available in the Anuket project.

This document is not intended to replace or replicate documentation from other upstream open source projects such as
KVM, OpenDaylight, OpenStack, etc., but to highlight the features and capabilities delivered through the Anuket project.

Introduction
============

Anuket provides infrastructure deployment options, which are able to be installed to host virtualised network functions
(VNFs) and cloud native network functions (CNFs). This document intends to help users leverage the features and
capabilities delivered by Anuket.

Feature Overview
================

The following links outline the feature deliverables from Anuket sub-projects. Each of the sub-projects provide detailed
descriptions about the features delivered including use cases, implementation, and configuration specifics in the
sub-project documentation.

The following Configuration Guides and User Guides assume that the reader already has some knowledge about a given
sub-project's specifics and capabilities. These Guides are intended to allow users to deploy and implement features that
are part of the Anuket release.

The `Anuket developer wiki  <http://wiki.anuket.io>`_ might contain more details about the specific projects.
