Anuket Test Frameworks
======================

If you have elected to install using the Anuket Kali Release toolchain,
you can begin to test once the installation is completed.
The basic deployment validation only addresses some of the capabilities in
any platform and you may want to execute more exhaustive tests. Some investigation will be required to
select the right test suites to run on your platform.

Many of the Anuket test projects provide user-guide documentation and installation instructions in :ref:`this document <testing-userguide>`
