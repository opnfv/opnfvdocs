Abstract
========

This is the installation document for the OPNFV Jerma release, please use this document for further reference. 

Installation Procedure
======================

Each of the test Frameworks and other projects will have separate installations procedures: see the individual project documentation.

- :ref:`Airship Installation Guide <airship-installation>`
- :ref:`Kuberef Installation Guide <kuberef-installation>`


OPNFV Test Frameworks
=====================

If you have elected to install the OPNFV platform using the deployment toolchain provided by OPNFV,
your system will have been validated once the installation is completed.
The basic deployment validation only addresses a small part of capabilities in
the platform and you may want to execute more exhaustive tests. Some investigation will be required to
select the right test suites to run on your platform.

Many of the OPNFV test project provide user-guide documentation and installation instructions in :ref:`this document <testing-userguide>`
