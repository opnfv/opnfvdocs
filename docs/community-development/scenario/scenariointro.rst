OPNFV Scenarios
---------------

The OPNFV project provides an integration and deployment environment for a variety of components
that can make up a virtualisation platform.  OPNFV identifies these variations on the composition of
the platform as scenarios.

A scenario in OPNFV can be defined as "a deployment of a specific set of platform components".  The
composition of a scenario may include specific SDN controller technologies, specific accelerate
switching technologies, or even specific configurations of components to achieve targeted platform
capabilities.  Each scenario behaves differetly and it is important to understand the behaviour you
want in order to target the specific scenario you wish to deploy prior to working with the
OPNFV platform.
