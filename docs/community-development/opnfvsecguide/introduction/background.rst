Background
----------

Pre-virtualization security protection was largely centered on the network.
Malicious attacks from hostile machines, would seek to exploit network based
operating systems and applications, with the goal of compromising their
target node.

Physical security had always been a much simpler business, with most focus on
the secure access of the data center hardware.
In-turn security was built up in layers (defense in depth) where machines
would be
daisy chained with network cables via  security appliances to provide
controlled segmentation and isolation.
This form of security was built upon the principle of an 'air gap'
being present,
whereby machines were separate physical units, joined largely by the
network stack.

With the advent of virtualization (namely the hypervisor), new attack
vectors have
surfaced as the 'air-gap' is no longer key design aspect for security.
Further to this elements orchestation nodes and network controllers
lead to an even wider attack surface:

* Guests breaking isolation of the hypervisor.

* Unauthorized access and control of supporting orchestration nodes.

* Unauthorized access and control of supporting overlay network control systems.

The hypervisor and the overlay network have now become the 'Achilles heel'
whereby all tenant data isolation is enforced within the hypervisor and its
abstraction
of hardware and the virtualized overlay network.

This guide has been formulated, in order to assist users of the OPNFV platform
in securing an Telco NFV / SDN environment.
